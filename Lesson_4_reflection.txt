When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

Remote repositories allow for you to easily share you files and provide backup and accessibility.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

Manually pulling changes allows you to know when code is changed allowing you to more easily program new variations of a program.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

  
What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?

This allows you to view the states of your remote offline in order to program without wifi.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub?  What would be easier,
and what would be harder?

The next best way to collaborate would be email, and then Piazza. I think email would be easier than Piazza, however both work. Git is the easiest way to collaborate though.

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in
master?  What benefits does each approach have?

The Master is primarily used for your final code that is used to operate a program. A seperate branch allows you to experiment with code that can possibly work in order to allow you to try new variations and possibly failing code.
